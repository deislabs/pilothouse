# Pilothouse

Pilothouse is a port of Helm in Rust, just for funsies. Initially, this is just
going to be a straight port of Helm 3 as a way for us to learn Rust, but it can
always evolve to be something more. The term comes from the place where a boat
is piloted from, generally containing the Helm (get it?)

PLEASE NOTE: This is _highly_ experimental and there are no guarantees of any
kind about current state or backwards compatibility
